			<h3>Challenge</h3>
				<!--- Creating Gravity in Alice 3-->
					<p>My biggest challenge this year was creating physics for my platformer <br /> game in Alice 3. I concluded that it was impossible to make realistic physics in Alice 3 due <br />not being able to apply a force to an object, only being able to make an object move to a target.</p>

			<h3>Growth</h3>
				<!---Game development -->
					<p>I learned a lot about game development during the Alice 3 unit. The biggest thing I learned to not bite off<br /> more that you can chew, with my goals being to make a physics engine and make a platformer in it, <br />however I realized that it was very hard so I had to settle on making it less realistic.</p>
