        <p>In my time as a 9th grader at DRSS, I have learned many skills and grown in numerous topics. Skills I have grown in include drawing, reasoning, grammar, and historical thinking, but the skill I have grown the most in is learning how to use Unreal Engine. In my history class this year, I was assigned a project to make a Virtual History Museum. The purpose of this museum was to display the knowledge I had learned during each unit by making an exhibit about the time period and including 3 artifacts of historical events that took place. When I started this project, I had no experience using Unreal Engine, so Mr. Potts provided us with an introductory packet, which I found very helpful. To start off, it gave us a quick introduction about the interface of Unreal Engine, as well as an overview of the tools it offered. </p>

        <!-- Gif of selecting move, rotate, scale  -->

        <p>After I had familiarized myself with interface, I was instructed to create a simple house with the knowledge I had just acquired. Using the engines default assets and some determination, I was able to create this house.</p>

        <p class="caption">Yap Caption Placeholder Yap Yap</p>

        <!-- Picture of first house, interior and exterior  -->

        <p>After completing my first house, the packet taught me about how I can use textures and lighting to create more interesting buildings. After I felt I had a decent understanding of these concepts, I decided to move on to making my second house, but this time with more details and a decorated exterior. After some time, I was able to create this house. </p>

        <!-- Pics of second house, interior and exterior  -->

        <p>After I had completed my first and second house, I was instructed to brainstorm potential ideas for my Virtual History Museum. I initially came up with the idea to have my museum set in the universe of The Magic School bus, with each exhibit being a different field trip that Ms. Fizzle took her students on. I planned on having the hub as Ms. Frizzle’s classroom and have the player select each exhibit my talking to Ms. Frizzle.</p>

        <p class="caption">Yap Caption Placeholder Yap Yap</p>

        <!-- Picture of ms. Frizzles classroom  -->

        <p>However, after further thought I realized that this idea was very impractical given the time frame and the skills I had at the time. To fully make this idea come to life I would have had to create numerous 3D models, which I did not know how to do, use animations, which I also did not know how to do, and most importantly make Mrs. Frizzle, which was way out of the range of skills that I had. After I realized that this idea was impractical, I went back to brainstorming.</p>

        <p>After some more time thinking, I came up with the idea to put my museum in a 3D scanned recreation of the school, thus eliminating the need for me to model anything. I planned to contact a school administrator and try to coordinate a date when I could come in after school so there would be no people who were included. However, upon further research, I realized that once again this idea was impractical. The only method I had found for importing 3D scanned models into Unreal Engine was unfortunately very computationally intensive to run, which our laptops simply lacked the power to perform. I was once again out of ideas, so I went back to brainstorming.  </p>

        <p>To try to find some inspiration about what I could make, I decided to scroll through a couple 3D asset websites. While I was scrolling through one of these websites, I came across a model of a hot air balloon. Upon seeing this model, I thought of the idea of having each one of my exhibits be a hot air balloon, with a large platform as the basket, and have them interconnected by bridges. This idea would require me to model the balloon part of the hot air balloon, but I figured that I could reuse the same asset for each exhibit so I would only have to create one in total, which I thought was manageable.</p>

        <p class="caption">Yap Caption Placeholder Yap Yap</p>

        <!-- Picture of initial brainstorming sketch (recreation)  -->

        <p>After approving this idea with Mr. Potts, I started working on the first exhibit. I planned to learn how to 3D model in blender so that I could create the balloon, however I decided to prioritize creating the exhibit’s content before the rest of the balloon. After I had finished putting the 3 Artifacts in, I decided to take a break from development, as I had other schoolwork I needed to work on, and I had already met the requirements of the project checkpoint.</p>

        <!-- First exhibit finished recreation  -->

        <p>Around the time of finishing my second exhibit, I was watching YouTube, when I came across this video by Acerola, a shader artist, where he created an ocean shader that never tiles. I find his videos fascinating even though I often do not understand what he is talking about.</p>
        <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400" alt="">
        <p class="caption">Yap Caption Placeholder Yap Yap</p>

        <!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPfagLeUa7k  -->

        <p>While I was watching his video, I got thinking about my Virtual Museum. I realized that I had been procrastinating learning 3D modeling because I was struggling to find the time and dedication to do so. I decided that I did not want to go thought with the hot air balloon idea, but that I would keep the exhibits that I had already completed, as I did not want to have to restart what I had already made. After thinking for a moment, I realized that I could simply add an ocean to my level to make it seem less empty. My first thought was to use the ocean that Acerola had created, but I discovered that he used Unity Engine not Unreal Engine, so I could not use it. I looked up a tutorial of how to create an ocean in an Unreal Engine and discovered that Unreal Engine had an integrated water plugin. Following the tutorial, I created an ocean under the exhibit platforms I made.</p>

        <!-- Picture of exhibits 1 and 2 with ocean  -->

        <p>One night while I was working on my third exhibit, the industrial revolution, I wanted to include the silent film that my group and I had created for the Industrial Revolution Silent Film Project. Since I did not like how it looked with just the video playing on a wall, I wanted to add a projector asset to make it slightly more realistic. I found an asset online, in .usd (Universal Scene Description) format. To be able to import this asset, I needed to enable a dedicated importer plugin within Unreal Engine.</p>

        <p>However, upon relaunching Unreal Engine, an error message popped up that the USD Importer plugin required a dependency that was not available on our laptops, due to restrictions that had been set. After dismissing that popup, another popup appeared, prompting me to either disable the plugin or close the engine. I clicked the button to disable the plugin, however it did not work, and Unreal Engine refused to open. I tried many times to open the project and disable the importer plugin, but all my attempts were unsuccessful. A checkpoint for the third exhibit was coming up, and faced potentially with having to completely restart, I sent an email to Mr. Potts explaining my situation and asking for an extension. He was understanding and gave me an extension to have more time to attempt to fix it or redo my entire museum. Since it was late at night, I decided to call it quits and get some sleep.</p>

        <p>The next day in PLP I was scrambling to try to fix my museum project. After more unsuccessful attempts to fix the problem, I accepted that I would have to restart. Fortunately, at this point I was somewhat unsatisfied with how my museum was coming together and I wanted to restart but figured that it was not worth restarting and throwing away all the progress that I had made so far. This problem turned out to be the perfect chance for me to redo my museum for the final time to create a final product that I was proud of.</p>

        <p>While working on the museum previously, I had come up with the idea of having a long hallway lined with bookshelves on the sides, with the exhibits being little inlets on the side of the hallway. I decided to go with this idea, as I was short on time and was a bit tired of brainstorming at this point.</p>

        <!-- AI generated concept image  -->

        <p>To start, I searched for a bookshelf model. I originally found separate models for the shelf and the books, however I realized that making various combinations of books on the shelf would take a large amount of time and they had a relatively high number of polygons which did not run well when I put many of them together to form a hallway. After more browsing, I found a bookshelf model that had books on it, as well as a small number of polygons.</p>

        <p class="caption">Yap Caption Placeholder Yap Yap</p>

        <!-- 3d model embed  -->

        <p>I began placing copies of the bookshelf in a line to form the hallway walls and making inlets for the exhibits.</p>

        <p class="caption">Yap Caption Placeholder Yap Yap</p>

        <!-- Completed hallway with no exhibits  -->

        <p>As part of the requirements for the exhibits, each one needed at least 3 interactive elements, to add interest and as an additional challenge for us creating the museum. What most people do is make text appear when you get close to the exhibit, however I did not like the way it looked. I attempted to change the font, but I could not get it working. I decided to put the text for the artifacts in an image so that I could customize it more. Since I was putting the text in an image and not having that as the interactive element, I needed to make something else interactive.</p>

        <p>While procrastinating, I saw a video online of a worker at an art gallery carefully angling a light to perfectly light up a piece of art. I was inspired and figured I could remake something similar with my museum to create an interactive element. My plan was to turn the lights on when I got close to the images on the wall. To make this element, I looked up a tutorial on how to use trigger boxes. In Unreal Engine, as the name suggests, you can use a trigger box to trigger an action based on an event like starting or ending collision.</p>

        <!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ29dA2Y8bE  -->

        <p>The tutorial is for Unreal Engine 5 but also works for 4.27. It also does not explicitly state how to use it to turn on and off lights, but I was able to extrapolate knowledge that I had learned previously to figure out how.</p>

        <p>At this point I was fairly satisfied with the museum that I had created, but I still felt it was missing the mood I was trying to make. I was pondering how to make it moodier, I remembered learning about how to use the post process volume. Post process volumes can apply effects to the virtual camera like white balance and exposure compensation.</p>

        <!-- Pic of museum without post process volume  -->

        <p>After some fiddling with settings, I was able to create a look that I was proud of, which is what I have stuck with.</p>

        <p>During this school year, I have gone from knowing absolutely nothing about how to use Unreal Engine to being confident in my ability to create visually appealing levels. Next year I may be able to take the Game Design class, where I will be able to deepen my knowledge of how to use Unreal Engine, which could be a fun hobby or even lead to job opportunities.</p>
