      <h2 class="whats-pbl-header">What is PBL?</h2>

      <p class="whats-pbl">
        Project Based Learning (PBL) is learning by doing, instead of learning
        by seeing. For example, if you wanted to find out how a pencil sharpener
        worked, without PBL you would just read a paragraph on how a pencil
        sharpener works. However, with PBL you might build your own pencil
        sharpener and find out how it works along the way. PBL is more engaging
        because students are more involved and active. This makes students more
        likely to enjoy the content and understand it better.

      <h2 class="pbl-in-stem-header">How is PBL used at DRSS?</h2>

      <p class="pbl-in-stem">
        We use PBL at DRSS by teaching skills through projects. For example,
        learning HTML and CSS by listening to a teacher talk about it and not do
        anything else is boring and not engaging. However, if you learn HTML and
        CSS by making a digital portfolio it is more engaging and fun. Learning
        with PBL makes it easier, in my opinion, to comprehend the content being
        taught.
