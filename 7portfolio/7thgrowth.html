    <p class="growth-text">
      The project I am showing growth in is the portfolio project. The
      professional competency I am going to address my growth is persistence.
      The most challenging part of this project was positioning elements because
      often if would not position itself where I wanted it to go. I resolved
      this challenge by persisting and trying different methods. This made a
      difference because the layout now looks professional and creative. I can
      now correctly position elements within a webpage because I learned that if
      you try hard enough, then you will eventually succeed. The feedback that
      helped me the most was Millan Naikâ€™s. After discussing with him, I decided
      that it was better to have the 5 qualities in a single column, instead of
      having the in two columns, side by side.
